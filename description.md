## 1. The Trust Crisis in Digital Collaboration

Despite a $16B+ freelance market, explosive growth in remote and knowledge work, and a global creator economy, **online digital collaboration is fraught with risk and unchecked inefficiency**:

- **Rampant Loss & Fraud:** Hundreds of billions are lost yearly to payment fraud, undelivered work, false disputes, and platform lockouts. Freelancers, artists, developers, and clients suffer.
- **High Platform Fees + Rigid, Siloed Workflows:** Upwork, Fiverr, and similar platforms extract 10‚Äì20% commission, enforce one-size-fits-all rules, and block cross-process innovation.
- **No Programmatic or Auditable Escrow:** Today, there is *no way* to execute nuanced payment splits, onchain milestone logic, or verifiable, privacy-respecting evidence logs.
- **Broad Opportunities Blocked:** Because of these shortcomings, many digital deals‚Äîmulti-author work, IP handover, cross-border collaboration, secure document or key exchange, custom royalties, or milestone payouts‚Äîare never even attempted.

***

## 2. DocPact: Platform, Protocol, and Trusted Rail

DocPact is **not** just "another freelance site." It‚Äôs an agent-driven protocol and full-stack dApp for **secure, programmable, agent-verified execution and settlement** of *any* digital asset or agreement‚Äîbuilt for the Onchain Cloud.

### Key Goals

- **Remove blind trust:** Enable strangers or emerging collaborators to transact securely, enforced by cryptography and programmable logic.
- **Power programmable payments:** Instantly support milestone/batch/royalty splits, atomic swaps, partial payouts, and revenue sharing‚Äîno platform interference.
- **Anchor every file, proof, contract, and log** on Filecoin with encrypted, modular, and audit-ready storage, leveraging decentralized proof and payment rails.
- **Enable privacy-by-design computation:** Leverage agent plugins, including advanced Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof support and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-backed AI orchestration for any level of verification and confidentiality. *This means even the agent cannot misuse or leak sensitive data during computation.*

***

## 3. Real Use Cases‚ÄîBeyond Freelance

DocPact revolutionizes trust in *any* digital industry needing verifiable value and programmable payments. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- **Team-based code or design bounties:** Reward split via onchain agent-verification of git commits, doc logs, or test pass rates.
- **High-value art/logo/eBook/media delivery:** Release payment only on agent-verified, format-checked, encrypted handover (e.g., only if watermark, size, and type are correct).
- **Technical content commissioning:** Automated plagiarism, quality, or format scan, with agent/AI approval before payout.
- **Confidential business/IP or key exchange:** Multi-stage, proof-driven asset transfer; keys/proofs released only on milestone/agent-verified satisfaction; guarantees secrecy even during agent execution via enclave/TEE.
- **In-game assets, NFTs, or digital collectibles:** Secure cross-game asset swaps or unlocks on agent or group verification.
- **Social media campaign/content strategy:** Commissions for content schedules, analytics, or influencer posts‚Äîdeliveries reviewed by AI/agent, payment triggered on proof.
- **Web3/DAO collaboration, audit, or voting:** Multi-sig/group outcomes, bounty payouts, and code audits released only after oracle/agent-verified conditions.
- **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) or TEE-protected verification:** Highly sensitive proofs or business logic executed inside secure enclaves‚Äîensuring neither party nor platform nor agent can leak data, *with onchain attestation/verification*.
- **Co-authored product launches, multi-party licensing:** Staged key reveals or royalty splitting executed via flexible agent contract logic.

#### Additional Use Cases (Illustrative, NOT Exhaustive)

- Secure documentation or manual handover for a startup sale (code, API keys, legal docs)
- Encrypted eBook or training package sales with agent-verified DRM/logic
- Split royalty revenue for ongoing team contributions to digital content/research/IP
- API/paywall access, digital collectible unlocks, personalized content delivery, hackathon bounty management

## 4. Under the Hood: How DocPact Works (Technical Walkthrough)

### 4.1 Contract Initiation (A)

Party A (buyer/client) defines the deal in the DocPact Next.js web app. Using conversational or form-based UI powered by **LangGraph agent orchestration**, they specify:

- All deliverables, assets, and formats (code, images, docs, media, keys, or anything else)
- Milestones, splits, payment/release conditions (supports partial delivery, staged payments, group splits)
- One or more verification agents (AI, script, oracle, or human)‚Äî*each can be chosen per contract, vertical, or even for deal stages*
- Deadlines, custom fees, optional NDA/encrypted instructions via on-chain metadata

> **Note:** No user account signup is forced‚Äî
  - Authentication and transaction signing is handled with **MetaMask**, **WalletConnect**, or similar EVM wallet providers.
  - Web app UI (Next.js, Tailwind CSS) delivers seamless onboarding and clear deal management.

### 4.2 Programmable Payment/Settlement

- User deposits tokens (primarily **USDFC**, with FEVM support) into the **FilecoinPay** escrow smart contract.
- The amount can cover:
  - Transactional payouts (to sellers/contributors)
  - Agent fees (custom per Agent)
  - Protocol fee (flat or %), if chosen
  - Gas & storage buffer
- DocPact (via SynapseSDK's PaymentsService/module) pre-checks balances, handles approvals, and builds a clean onchain summary for all parties.

### 4.3 Submission and Evidence Storage (B)

- Seller/contributor authenticates and uploads deliverables using the DocPact Next.js frontend.
- **All uploads are** AES/ChaCha-encrypted *client-side*; encryption key is generated *per deal*.
- Upload pipeline uses:
  - `@filoz/synapse-sdk/StorageService` :  
    - `createStorage({ withCDN: true })` for fast, warm storage; deal assets and logs later autopushed to cold storage for perpetual access.
  - Each CID (content identifier) and metadata is logged onchain in contract state for agent and audit access.
  - For **large assets** (video, zipped repos), chunked upload + stream processing is supported.

### 4.4 Verifiable AI/Agent Review

- Agents are orchestrated through **LangGraph** (multi-agent, multi-stage orchestration framework for conversational, logic, or workflow agents).
- **AI, script, or human-based agent** (can include multiple nodes in LangGraph) receives a notification, proves identity, and fetches CIDs directly from Filecoin storage via SynapseSDK.
- Using embedded **encryption keys**, agents decrypt files **ONLY in controlled contexts**:
  - For normal flows, decrypt in isolated ephemeral containers (never stored, not accessible to agent developer).
  - For sensitive/critical verification flows‚Äî**run inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)/enclave** (e.g., Intel SGX, AWS Nitro, Oasis, Conclave/Consensys):  
    - The TEE attests its hardware status and loaded code on entry, ensuring that *only* the intended verification code runs, not arbitrary/untrusted code.
    - Neither the host system, agent creators, nor anyone else can see in-memory secrets during execution.
    - Outputs are *attested*‚Äîrecipient can verify TEE (or cloud provider/chain) hardware signature matches expected code hash.
- Agent runs programmable logic (file signature, test suite, watermark, plagiarism/AI check, ZK proof gen or verification, repo content matcher, asset unlock code).
- If using **ZK-proofs**:  
  - Parties can submit or generate ZK proofs within the workflow.  
  - Example: B produces ZK proof that ‚Äúuploaded file matches some public hash, passes all checks‚Äù without revealing file itself.  
  - ZK proofs are verified either by agent plugins, TEE, or, in the future, onchain as ZK rollups mature.

> - **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs or enclaves)‚Äîsuch as Intel SGX, AWS Nitro, Oasis, Consensys Conclave**‚Äîisolate code and data away from host OS/app, providing cryptographic attestation that secret data is only processed inside the tested enclave, and output is only released if computation is unmodified.
> - **DocPact can compose ZK and TEE:** Host ZK proof circuits *inside* TEEs, so that even proof generation is never seen by the agent‚Äôs host or network, for ‚Äúdefense-in-depth‚Äù.

### 4.5 Payment, Disclosure, and Handover

- On agent or ZK/TEE-verified pass, the DocPact smart contract releases USDFC (via FilecoinPay or Synapse PaymentsService) to B, per contract stipulations (full, split, or staged as defined in contract/milestone logic).
- If present, the deal-specific decryption key is released to client (A); all deliverables become accessible and verifiable.
- Failure/dispute/agent or attestation failure results in protocol-triggered refund, return-to-draft, burn, or optional mediation. *All steps are logged on Filecoin for full, cryptographic audit and replay.*

### 4.6 Secure, Auditable Storage and Privacy

- **Every file, log, and contract event is pushed to Filecoin via Synapse SDK**, using decentralized proofs, audit trails, and content-addressed storage.
- Blockchain event logs + offchain Merkle proofs anchor every workflow; *no lost evidence or ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù‚Äîall deal artifacts verifiable anytime*.
- **Client-driven encryption** always, with one-time or agent/TEE-scoped decryption‚Äî**no agent or storage provider ever sees confidential data unless contracted and attested for that session**.

### 4.7 Detailed Integration & Full Stack ‚Äî Packages, SDKs, and Agent Architecture

**Front End & Back End:**  
- `next`, `react`, `typescript`, and `tailwindcss`: Unified SSR/CSR dApp for onboarding, dashboards, API routes (private/public endpoints), agent triggers, admin interfaces.
- All API flows (deal creation, file upload, agent triggers, key disclosures) orchestrated with Next.js serverless endpoints for security and performance.

**Agent Orchestration:**  
- `langgraph`: All DocPact agent code/automation runs as composable graphs‚Äîhandle multi-node, multi-stage, and conditional flows; supports agent-to-agent, agent AI to human review, and agent to TEE/Conclave.
- Pluggable module support for ZK-proof checkers, TEE/conclave calls, and oracle integrations.
- AI API calls (optional): Allow decentralized/3rd party LLM APIs (e.g., Bittensor, Gensyn) for advanced content evaluation (run in ephemeral or TEE-protected env).

**Filecoin/Onchain Cloud:**  
- `@filoz/synapse-sdk` (StorageService, PaymentsService, Pandora/PDP, CommP utilities): Everything from encrypted upload to retrieval, programmable cost estimation, and modular payment flows.
- All Filecoin/FEVM interactions (wallet auth, payment/approval, contract agent triggers, event logging) using EVM-compatible tools.
- `filecoinpay` contract libraries for onchain USDFC escrow, payout, and refund.

**Encryption, Key, and Privacy:**  
- `crypto`, `webcrypto`, `libsodium`, or `tweetnacl` for client-side AES/ChaCha encryption.
- Optional browser fingerprinting and deal-specific entropy salts for per-session secrets.

**Confidential/Enclave Verification:**  
- Enclave/TEE SDKs e.g., `node-sgx`, `@consensys/conclave-client`, or cloud TEEs (Azure Confidential Ledger, AWS Nitro, Oasis, etc.)
- For ZK, proof circuits can be generated with `circom`, `snarkjs` or (future) Noir for agent/contract hybrid verification.

**Testing + CI/CD:**  
- `jest`, `playwright` for end-to-end, workflow, and UI tests.
- `testcontainers` for staging multi-agent, multi-contract testnets.
